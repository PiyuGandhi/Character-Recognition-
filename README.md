# Character Recognition 


## Background:-

This repository uses the not_mnist dataset for character recognition. Both the assignments were part of Deep Learning With Udacity course

## Tasks:-

1. Recognition using simple Logistic Classifier - notebook 1_notmnist.ipynb
2. Using Tensorflow, a hidden RELU neural network and gradient descent - notebook 2_fullyconnected.ipynb

## Accuracy:-

1. 89.28%
2. 91.4%
